But it was the year of putting fun back in the kitchen.\n\nFor the last few years, immersion circulators and sous vide cooking have been de rigeur in many food enthusiasts' kitchens (though brands like Nomiku are upping the ante this year with revamped designs and Wi-Fi access). \n\nSee also: The ultimate gift guide for the techie in your life\n\nNow it's not just about doing new things in the kitchen; it's about reinventing the way you do old things. \n\nThrow a cocktail party at the click of a button. Make ramen at home with your kids. It's all about having fun in the kitchen and \u2014 of course \u2014\u00a0eating and drinking well. \n\nThese gadgets range from the low-tech to the positively futuristic, and though some aren't quite yet available, they seem so cool that it would be a mistake not to include them. \n\nHere are the coolest kitchen gadgets around, from stocking stuffers to luxurious dream items. \n\n1. Drop \u2014 $99.95\n\nAny baker knows measuring ingredients is the best way to get perfect results every time. Just download the related app on your phone; then the scale measures each ingredient and actually tells you when you've added enough. \n\nYou can even mix drinks using the scale, which tells you how much and when to add each liquor. It's precision without the guess-and-check of a traditional kitchen scale. \n\n2. Imperial Spherificator \u2014 $174.99\n\nThis science-meets-snacks machine is unfailingly cool, delicious and weird all at once. It makes almost any liquified substance into dozens of tiny, jellied balls at the touch of a button. Once you get the hang of the ratios of ingredient, water and algae powder down, the machine is simple to use and really fun. Your guests will be impressed at your basil spheres, they will laugh with delight when you turn soda into tiny balls for a molecular cocktail and they will probably be grossed out if you try to spherify bacon for them. \n\n3. Fruit Plant \u2014 $29.62-$37.49\n\nNot everything new has a strictly \"technological\" component. This ingenious kitchen gadget packs 10 kitchen tools into one aesthetically pleasing package. Included are your avocado scoop, masher, five picks (perfect for cocktail olives), citrus cutter, mesh cutter, apple cutter, lemon juicer, grater, grapefruit juicer and bowl. Sure they are all on the small size, but that makes it ideal for an apartment kitchen, cooking for one and easy cleanup. \n\n4. Somabar \u2014 $429\n\nIf this ends up being half as cool as it looks, your neighborhood bar has some serious competition. This countertop machine makes craft cocktails at the push of a button. Six Soma Pods distribute the ideal amount of each liquor or mixer into your glass, according to how strong you want it. The machine is controlled by an app on your phone, which also suggests cocktails based on the ingredients in your pods. Plan on lots of guests at your house if you get this project, which is now available for pre-order.\n\n5. Cinder \u2014 $249\n\nThis ultra precise griddle picks up where sous vide left off. It's a precision griddle that claims it cooks food to an exact temperature, then holds it at that temperature without continuing to cook the food, until you are ready to eat. Unlike traditional sous vide, it can sear, caramelize and saut\u00e9. And Serious Eats reports it nearly eliminates the pesky grease splatters and smoke you tend to get from making things like cheeseburgers. For the serious at-home chef, this could be an incredible toy when it's ready to ship in 2016. \n\n6. Butter Mill \u2014 $19.95\r\n  A photo posted by Cooks Innovations (@cooksinnovations) on Aug 20, 2015 at 1:23pm PDT\n\nIf you've ever suffered from cold butter and crunchy crackers, you know real pain. The Butter Mill grinds thin, soft butter shavings onto your vehicle of choice. The butter will be soft, airy and guaranteed to spread easily over even the softest slice of bread. When you're done, just store the container, butter and all, right in the fridge. \n\n7.  Kids Easy-Make Ramen \u2014 $49.50\n\nThis Japanese ramen maker is marketed toward kids but is easily one of the coolest noodle machines on the market. The name is O-Uchi de Ramenya, which translates to \"ramen restaurant in your home.\" The process seems similar to making other types of noodles. Sure, you could probably use your pasta maker to make ramen noodles, but whoever said holiday gifts were about logic? \n\n8. Tea-Cer\u00e9 - $299.99\n\nThe ancient craft of brewing and whisking Japanese matcha tea is now automated. This machine grinds, brews and whisks your tea to an ideal froth while all you do is choose your teacup. \n\n9. PicoBrew - $559 - $999\n\nBrew your own 5 liter mini-kegs of beers from the likes of Dogfish Head from compostable PicoPak boxes. PicoBrew licenses recipes and ingredients from over 70 craft breweries and 350 home-brewers worldwide so you can brew tap-quality beer on your countertop in about a week. Plus, thanks to similar technology, the machine doubles as a sous vide machine. It starts shipping in 2016\n\n10. Auroma One - $399\n\nThis highly customizable coffee machine features temperature control, a scale for water-to-coffee ratio and a sensor that measures how much coffee dissolves in each cup brewed. After you drink your coffee, rate the flavor on the accompanying app, scoring tastes like bitterness, texture and caffeine kick. The app helps make your next cup of coffee more to your liking. \n\n11. Fizzics - $189\n\nThis countertop machine claims to turn any storebought can or bottle of beer into a draught-quality glass. It's battery operated and using sound waves and oscillation pours the perfect glass of beer with a creamy, frothy head. It is set to start delivering this month if you pre-order on the IndieGoGo site.  \n\n12. Neo - $99 for two \n\nOnce you input the ingredient information on the accompanying app, this smart-jar remembers how much food is in your jar, the nutritional content of it and adds it to an app-enabled shopping list when you are running low. It also keeps track of best-before dates if you store items that might spoil. It has bluetooth connectivity and wireless charging so you never run out of quinoa right before that special \"meet the parents\" dinner. \n\n13. Pantelligent - $199\n\nWith its associated app, Pantelligent's central temperature gauge tells you exactly when your food is cooked to your ideal temperature. Tap your phone to the pan's handle, enter the information about your dinner and the app walks you though cooking your meal. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

The legendary football coach developed the West Coast Offense, a strategy that diversified the air attack with quick passes to involve more receivers. Referred to in one documentary as \"volumes of poetry in motion,\" this revolutionary system won the San Francisco 49ers three Super Bowls in the 80s -- and has become the blueprint for nearly every offense in the NFL.\n\nBefore his death in 2007, Walsh started a family tree with more than \"25 descendants,\" including multiple Super Bowl champions. He built a legacy not just by being a visionary coach, but by being a great teacher.\n\nWith 12 seasons on Grey's Anatomy, six seasons on the now-departed Private Practice, five seasons on Scandal and through her production company Shondaland, Rhimes is, too, well on her way to building a legacy that will impact television for decades to come. \n\nShe's not just a visionary power-producer. She's also a great teacher.\n\nA quick survey of our vast television universe says it all: From ABC's hugely popular three-show lineup on Thursday nights to the Lifetime network to series we haven't even seen yet, alumni of Shondaland University are using its lessons to make distinct, self-assured TV shows of their own.\n\nRhimes herself didn't even realize this until recently. Like, a year ago-recently.\n\n\"I've always been doing this job, but I've always been doing this job. Last year was when I stepped back and said, 'What am I going to focus on this year?'\" Rhimes tells Mashable. \"Last year was the year I said I was going to focus on leadership ... and figure out how to make that a thing.\"\n\nThis was specifically during her Year of Yes, which also happens to be the title of her new book.\n\nIn Year of Yes, the Chicago native chronicles a roughly 12-month period, starting around 2014, that changed her life -- a life that needed more help than her success would suggest. The book also chronicles how Rhimes went from a little girl playing pretend in a pantry to a woman building worlds on the biggest of stages.\n\nWhat becomes clear in the memoir, released Tuesday, is that Rhimes was always a gifted, natural storyteller. But the tale of Shonda Rhimes, the leader? That's a story best told by those she's been leading.\n\nSaying 'yes' to your skills\n\nBarbie Kligman was a little bit lost when she wandered into Shondaland in 2010. \n\nWell, wandered into, meaning worked her ass off to get there. \n\n\" data-credit-label=\"\" data-credit-provider=\"Custom type\" data-caption=\"Barbie Kligman\" title=\"BarbieKligman\" src=\"http://mashable.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/BarbieKligman.jpg\" alt=\"BarbieKligman\" width=\"1997\" height=\"1124\" class=\"\" />\n\nShe wasn't green by any means; in fact, on the day she started at Private Practice, her list of credits was enough to make anyone in the writers' room sick with IMDB envy. Kligman had already worked on Everwood, the gone-too-soon but excellent Jack & Bobby and CSI: NY. She had just come off a gig at The Vampire Diaries, which, in her words, \"wasn't a good fit.\"\n\nKligman diplomatically details something that happens to the best of writers: Sometimes, you just don't connect with the subject matter. Or you don't work well with a group. Any number of factors can make even the best-seeming gig not the right gig for you, she says. Accepting that can wear you down.\n\n\"I guess you'll find those people who are just unquestionably arrogant, but most of us -- because so much of this business is, 'What have you done lately?' -- so much of our internal struggle is, 'What have I done lately?'\" she says. \"'Do I have anything new to say? How do I say it? Is anyone going to care?'\" \n\nAs it turned out, Rhimes cared a lot. \n\nKligman spend Seasons 4 and 5 as a co-executive producer on the Private Practice, learning the ropes: how to write and rewrite at a hypersonic pace, the fine art of penning medical-based moral and ethical debates. The characters' sometimes-heated discussions set Practice apart from its Grey's Anatomy mothership early on -- becoming the \"spine\" of the series, Kligman says -- and became part of its legacy.\n\nCome Season 6, Kligman and Jennifer Cecil were handed the keys to the castle and given a chance to lead the show. The responsibility made a huge difference in Kligman's career, she says -- thanks to both the opportunity and the trust Rhimes put in her and Cecil. \n\n\"When someone like Shonda indicates to you that you seem to know what you're doing, that helps you to go, 'Wait a minute, she thinks I can do it. I can't be a complete idiot,'\" Kligman says.\n\nKligman is now in production on Season 2 of ABC's Secrets and Lies, a show she developed and executive produces that tackles a new criminal case each season and will feature a mostly new cast in year 2. It's no short order, but Kligman says she has things figured out thus far -- without being, she jokes, \"universally despised.\" She also has a lot of help, particularly from her \"second,\" co-executive producer Judith McCreary. Her confidence in McCeary, it seems, is not unlike the trust Rhimes once put in her.\n\n\"That's the thing about leadership. It's about delegating and trusting,\" she says.\n\nAnd trusting yourself -- something Kligman admits that she learned how to do better than ever while at Shondaland. \n\n\"It was a tremendous experience because ... being there allowed me to regain faith in what I could do,\" she says. \n\nSaying 'yes' to being there\n\nBonds run deep and loyalty deeper in the Shondaland family. At least, that's the sense you get talking to alums who've stayed in contact with Rhimes -- and each other -- even after leaving the nest. \n\nJenna Bans is one such alum. \n\nWhile it's not uncommon to find writers within Shondaland who've jumped from one of the company's hit shows to another, Bans has served time on nearly every one. She started on Private Practice, pivoted to Grey's, went on to develop her own Shondland show, Off the Map, and ended up on Scandal when Map was cancelled after one season.\n\nWhen Bans calls Mashable, she's in the middle of filming her seventh episode of a new show, The Family -- a dark midseason political drama that sees her reunite with Friday Night Lights alum Zach Gilford. The actor, with whom Bans also worked on Map, is taking on a role that's in many ways the opposite of FNL's Matt Saracen. Similarly, the series also takes Bans out of Shondaland for the first time and into business with Mandeville Television -- but not, apparently, away from the watchful eye of Rhimes. \n\nLast year, Bans asked Rhimes to give the pilot for The Family a read. Bans penned it while also writing on Scandal, a job from which she says she was given generous time off to complete the pilot script. Rhimes's review was glowing.\n\n\"If they don't pick this up, I'm going to call them and tell them that this is the best thing,\" Bans remembers Rhimes saying after she read the screenplay.\n\nIt didn't come to that -- but once the pilot was shot, Rhimes sent Bans her \"star editor\" Matt Ramsey, who's worked on every Shondaland show, as well as the pilot for How to Get Away With Murder.\n\n\"I think what's so great about her is that some showrunners would discourage you from leaving and doing your own thing, and she's the opposite,\" Bans says. \"I thinks she really prioritizes letting us have our own successes, which I don't think a lot of people do.\"\n\nThe duo most recently had breakfast a little more than a week ago, huddled in the back of a hotel restaurant. Even though Rhimes is as recognizable as some of the actors on her shows these days, \"she's very generous with her time, her advice and her resources,\" says Bans. \"I cannot see that happening in a lot of production companies across Hollywood.\" \n\nWithin Shondaland, too, friendships form among the next generation of executive producers. Pete Nowalk, creator of How to Get Away with Murder, has become a bit of a lifeline, says Bans. They talk on the phone at least once a week. \n\nShe and Nowalk started on Private Practice together. And Scandal writers' room alum Allan Heinberg, with whom they've both worked, is now executive producer and show runner on The Catch, a Shondaland drama set to debut in 2016. \n\nAs Bans says, \"It's such a great place, because it really teaches you how to grow up and go off and do your own thing.\" \n\nSaying 'yes' to good habits\n\nDoing \"your own thing,\" by the way, doesn't necessarily mean leaving home. Case in point: Nowalk, the man behind How to Get Away with Murder, a show produced by Shondaland. \n\nNow in its second season, the show tends to be the first example that comes to mind when talking about Rhimes' television legacy -- and for good reason. It shares a night with her two other hits, it has the same breakneck pace as Scandal, and its cast looks like a reflection of the actual world, with diverse actors in key roles.\n\nThe latter point, of course, is one that's gotten more ink in mainstream media than some television shows receive during entire seasons. Shondaland's well-noted \"colorblind casting\" approach and commitment to behind-the-scenes diversity is laudable, but as those within the company have pointed out, the conversation shouldn't only hinge on those who are promoting diversity on television. It should also be about those who aren't.\n\nNowalk doesn't bristle when he's asked about diversity, though -- because as a writer who got his first television job under that roof, the company's commitment to \"normalcy,\" as Rhimes calls it, helped form good habits. Habits that will become building blocks for change that extends beyond Thursday nights on ABC in the long-term, as students of Shondaland U break out and move on to create their own series.\n\nOn How to Get Away, they have carried on the colorblind casting tradition, making exceptions only when there's a noted a disparity. \"Every once in a while, if we feel like there hasn't been a type of person represented, we will maybe tell casting, 'Maybe focus on this area of a person,'\" Nowalk says. \n\nThat step back is key -- a sort of self-check mechanism. \n\n\"Everyone should have a seat at the table,\" Nowalk says. \n\nNowalk knows what it's like to not have that seat. While he was growing up in the '90s, he couldn't help noticing and feeling excluded by the lack of gay characters on TV.\n\n\"Knowing how much that could have changed my life -- just seeing more gay people on TV and feeling like there was a place for me in the world -- I think every writer in Shondaland is always checking themselves,\" he says\n\nThat can also mean putting forth an alternate reality of sorts. Last season, for example, while researching a scene set in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, Nowalk realized that the court's actual lineup was overwhelmingly male. (In fact, Justice Debra McCloskey Todd is the sole female justice in the state.) So the series decided to add another woman to the mix. \n\n\"That was a case where we said, 'Let's not do what's real. Let's do what we want the world to be,'\" Nowalk says. \"I think that's a power we have -- to put out powerful images.\"\n\nSaying 'yes' to leadership\n\nRhimes herself makes this all sound so simple. \n\nWrite a hit show? OK. Write multiple hit shows? OK. Write a book, appear on The Mindy Project, teach your writers, mentor your former writers and be home in time for dinner and family time at 7 p.m.? OK. \n\nAnd yes, that last one is a rule. \n\nEven her philosophy on leadership is seemingly without frills: There's no hierarchy.\n\nRhimes' first experience inside a TV writers room was Grey's Anatomy, where she sat at the head of the table. Was there learning to be done? Yes. But she also had no bad habits to break, no Hollywood B.S. legacy to uphold.\n\n\"I don't care where a good idea comes from, I don't care where a good scene comes from, I don't care where a good script comes from,\" she says. \"Everybody is equal in that sense, so everyone is valued. To have that feeling, that everyone is valued, gives people a sense of ownership.\"\n\nThat ownership, by the way, is something she feels strongly about. Rhimes isn't the type of person you'll see taking credit for the work or accomplishments of those who have walked through the Shondaland doors. \n\nNot Klingman. Not Bans. Not Turk. \n\nNot Marti Noxon, who produces Lifetime's critically acclaimed UnREAL. Not Tony Phelan or Joan Rater, who are under an overall deal at CBS. Not Brian Tanen, a producer on Devious Maids. Not Craig Turk, an executive producer on The Good Wife. \n\nAnd especially not Nowalk, who wasn't getting the credit he deserved for penning How to Get Away With Murder early in the show's run -- which still baffles Rhimes. It was \"shocking\" to her that people would assume that because she was producing the show, she was also writing it.\n\n\"And once I realized that what was happening, two things -- one, a little selfish: I don't want to be held responsible for every word. I also don't want people thinking I'm an octopus with a million arms writing everything,\" she says with a laugh. \"But two: Pete's got a beautiful voice and amazing ideas. The stuff he's doing, I remember what it was like to be in your first season and sweating blood over every word and every moment. How dare somebody else take credit for that!\"\n\nHer main job as a producer, she says, is to \"block and tackle.\" Create a clear path for creativity. Create a safe space for her writers to work in peace.\n\nLike those she mentors, Rhimes will say she doesn't do anything without help. On the business side she has Betsey Beers, her producing partner and multiple hat-wearer. On the family side, she writes in Year of Yes about her beloved nanny. On the mentoring side, well, Shondaland is often just a stop on many writers' long journeys.\n\nIt's like an Emmy speech: No one ever thanks just one person. But to many writers, Rhimes and Shondaland is certainly an important one.\n\n\"It's nice, it feels like there's a community out there,\" says Rhimes. \"I don't think I ever really thought about it that hard until Jenna [Bans] left just because we're all so tight-knit. Jenna had been here so long that when Jenna left, I went 'Wow.' I really looked around at how many people are out there, and there are a lot of us scattered around.

Utah officials and the couple filed court challenges demanding that the judge rescind the order.\n\nAshley Sumner, spokeswoman for the Utah Division of Child and Family Services, said the agency is cautiously optimistic and relieved. But Johansen's decision still leaves open the possibility that he could order the child removed at a Dec. 4 custody hearing, she said.\n\n\"We're moving in the right direction, but it's not the final answer,\" Sumner said.\n\nIn his first ruling, Johansen mentioned research that said children do better when raised by heterosexual families and that \"same-sex marriages have double the rate of instability as heterosexual marriages.\"\n\nThat language was crossed out in Johansen's new order. It now says the court merely cited concerns that research has shown children are more emotionally and mentally stable when raised by a mother and father in the same home.\n\nThe American Psychological Association has said there's no scientific basis that gay couples are unfit parents based on sexual orientation.\n\nJim Hunnicutt, a lawyer for the couple, said they are happy the judge rescinded the order so quickly.\n\n\"These two people are excellent, wonderful parents,\" he said. \"They love the child every much, and they are very optimistic that the child will remain in their care.\"\n\nHunnicutt said he didn't know what caused the judge to change his mind but that the initial decision violated the Constitution and harmed the baby.\n\n\"What I have to assume is that when the law was put right in front of his face, he realized that he had made a mistake, and he wanted to correct it and do the right thing and do what was constitutional,\" the attorney said.\n\nHunnicutt said his clients were shocked and angered after Tuesday's hearing, but were encouraged by the outpouring of support from around the country in the days since.\n\nChild welfare officials are working to keep the family together and hope that the public outcry surrounding the case sends a strong message to the judge, Sumner said.\n\n\"We're really happy for this family, and we want to see them stay together,\" she added.\n\nHoagland, a stay-at-home mother, and Peirce, a paramedic, are among a group of same-sex married couples who were allowed to become foster parents in Utah after last summer's U.S. Supreme Court ruling that made gay marriage legal across the country. State officials don't keep an exact count but estimate there are a dozen or more foster parents who are married same-sex couples.\n\nThe move to take the baby away generated widespread criticism, including from national gay rights groups and Utah Gov. Gary Herbert.\n\n Have something to add to this story?

What's magical about kindness is that it makes both the doer and the recipient of the kindness feel the positivity. This is a feeling that you'll carry through your day or week, during which you're likely to carry on that kindness and do something kind for someone else. This World Kindness Day, spotting and celebrating kindness is easier than ever with the help of KIND.\n\nSince day one, KIND has been on a mission to spread the idea that kindness is more than one act: It's a state of mind. And the snack brand inspires and celebrates kindness every day.\n\nThis year, KIND is using World Kindness Day as a catalyst for an expansion of its #kindawesome program -- an initiative that seeks to celebrate kindness by visiting howkindofyou.com.\n\nAnnually, World Kindness Day serves to celebrate and acknowledge people who perform acts of kindness and to encourage others to do so whenever they can. This year, the day dedicated to empowering people to make the world a little bit kinder falls on Friday, Nov. 13. (Friday the 13th doesn't seem so unlucky anymore, does it?)\n\nIn 2013, KIND kicked off the #kindawesome initiative to enable its team members to acknowledge the good acts they see in their daily lives. The KIND team was given #kindawesome cards to hand out to show appreciation whenever they witnessed someone doing good in the world.\n\nTo include scale and convenience, KIND decided to add technology and brought the cards online, allowing everyone to get involved. This way, anyone can send some deserved appreciation to those who make the world that much better.\n\nAnd when you're on the receiving end of a #kindawesome card (be it physical or digital), you can redeem it for a free KIND snack.\n\nAt howkindofyou.com, you can do two things:\n\n\tRedeem your #kindawesome card you\u2019ve received from a team member for your snack.\r\n\tRecognize someone for their kind act by sending a card (and snack) to them via Facebook, Twitter or email.\n\nSo when you see a friend hold the door open for someone whose hands are full, or give someone words of encouragement, you now have a way to show your appreciation of these small but meaningful gestures.\n\nKIND's hope is that through the easy and wide-spread digital sharing of #kindawesome cards, others will become inspired to commit kind acts of their own. With the launch of #kindawesome, KIND is empowering people to recognize those around them doing small kind acts, both online and offline, creating chains of kindness between friends and strangers alike.\n\nTo see how you can send your appreciation to someone who\u2019s done a kind act, visit howkindofyou.com and use the hashtag #kindawesome to share your own stories and experiences."},"shares":{"twitter":491,"facebook":137,"linked_in":19,"google_plus":16,"total":663},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzL2ZhL2ltYWdlMDAxLmQwOTY4LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/e9fe48f9/5be/image001.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzL2ZhL2ltYWdlMDAxLmQwOTY4LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/b5024348/5be/image001.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzL2ZhL2ltYWdlMDAxLmQwOTY4LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE3NXgxNzUjCmUJanBn/e91b7a5f/5be/image001.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzL2ZhL2ltYWdlMDAxLmQwOTY4LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1MHgzNTAjCmUJanBn/444d980f/5be/image001.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzL2ZhL2ltYWdlMDAxLmQwOTY4LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTgweDgwIwplCWpwZw/77219a11/5be/image001.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzL2ZhL2ltYWdlMDAxLmQwOTY4LmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE2MHgxNjAjCmUJanBn/38972dde/5be/image001.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1OIubaB","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"Now's your chance to show those around you how much you appreciate their acts of kindness.

Those on its colder, drier northeast corner were thought to be stable.\n\nBut a new study detailed in the journal Science shows that two of those glaciers are showing worrying changes, and that one has been retreating at an accelerating rate in recent years as it faces a dual attack by warm air from above and warm water from below.\n\nSEE ALSO: Two maps show Greenland\u2019s sudden melt season onset\n\nThese shifts mean this area of the frozen expanse could increase Greenland's contributions to overall sea level rise in the coming years, the study researchers conclude.\n\nThe results show the changes that are piling up in the fastest-warming region of the planet, the Arctic, as the world heats up from the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\n\"One more sector of Greenland is affected by the change\" in Earth's climate, study co-author Jeremie Mouginot, an associate project scientist at the University of California, Irvine, said.\n\nFrom stable to retreat\n\nThe mass of miles-thick ice that covers most of Greenland could raise global sea levels by some 20 feet if it all melted. It is already estimated to have contributed 30% of the 8 inches of sea level rise that has occurred since the beginning of the 20th century.\n\nIn order to improve predictions of what Greenland could funnel into the oceans as warming continues, scientists are working to better understand the processes that are causing its glaciers to melt and retreat. To do this they are using a number of tools, including airborne radar surveys and myriad satellite instruments, to get a clearer picture of what is happening at the surface of the ice and at its base, where it glides over bedrock.\n\nSEE ALSO: Here\u2019s what the inside of Greenland looks like, in 3D\n\nThe new study compiled data from some of the sources for two marine glaciers in northeast Greenland, Zachariae Isstrom and its neighbor, Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden. Together, these glaciers, essentially slowly flowing rivers of ice, reach deep into the center of the ice sheet, draining about 12% of it. The two glaciers hold enough ice to raise sea levels by about 3.5 feet. Marine glaciers are ones that run from land to sea, where the ice begins to float. That tongue of floating ice is called an ice shelf and acts as a doorstop, buttressing the glacier behind it.\n\nIn their data, the researchers saw that while Zachariae was stable for decades, that all changed when a huge chunk of its ice shelf broke off in 2002-03, after which the remainder continued to crumble. Today it is only 5% of the size it was in 2002.\n\nWith that stabilizing force reduced, the glacier steadily retreated until 2012, when it noticeably sped up and started shedding ice from its grounding line, the point where ice transitions from land to the sea. The team calculated that between 2011 and 2015, the grounding line retreated the same amount as it had in the 15 years prior, a quadrupling of its retreat rate.\n\nLikewise, the surface flow of the glacier tripled its acceleration after the 2012 event, and the thinning of the glacier and its ice shelf doubled, the researchers found.\n\n\"The new results are important and consistent with earlier findings,\" Shfaqat Khan, a senior researcher at the Technical University of Denmark who has studied the same glaciers but wasn't involved in the new study, said in an email.\n\nWhile Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden is also rapidly melting, it isn't retreating as quickly because the bedrock beneath it slopes upward toward the sea, whereas the ground below Zachariae slopes downward, speeding its way. But if Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden's ice shelf sees a similar breakup, the pace of its retreat could also quicken. The same is true for other northern glaciers that are currently stable but seem to have some of the same processes at work.\n\nJust 'the beginning'\n\nRight now the total amount of melt from Zachariae is small compared to other big-name retreating glaciers, like Jakobshavn Isbrae in the southeast. But that could easily change, Mouginot said. \"Right now it's at the beginning.\"\n\n\"If the current trend continues, the northeast corner will become a significant contributor, or perhaps the largest contributor, in the near future,\" Khan said.\n\nThe researchers think that the melt and retreat of the northeast glaciers is due to a combination of warmer air at the surface and an invasion of warm water cutting away at the ice shelf and glacier from below. The problem is they don't have direct measurements of water temperatures there, something Mouginot said he and his colleagues were lobbying to include in efforts like NASA's Oceans Melting Greenlandresearch initiative.\n\nBut based on what they do know, Mouginot and his colleagues write that, \"the destabilization of this marine-based sector will increase sea-level rise from the Greenland Ice Sheet for decades to come.\""},"shares":{"twitter":635,"linked_in":7,"facebook":61,"google_plus":1,"total":704},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzL2RlL21lbHRpbmdnbGFjLmU1YzIyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/4a6bd74c/dbb/melting-glacier.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzL2RlL21lbHRpbmdnbGFjLmU1YzIyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/ad0d5f50/dbb/melting-glacier.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzL2RlL21lbHRpbmdnbGFjLmU1YzIyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE3NXgxNzUjCmUJanBn/af446e3b/dbb/melting-glacier.jpg","query":true,"size":"175x175#"},{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzL2RlL21lbHRpbmdnbGFjLmU1YzIyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTM1MHgzNTAjCmUJanBn/31d30cce/dbb/melting-glacier.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"350x350#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzL2RlL21lbHRpbmdnbGFjLmU1YzIyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTgweDgwIwplCWpwZw/891e6ee5/dbb/melting-glacier.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"80x80#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzL2RlL21lbHRpbmdnbGFjLmU1YzIyLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE2MHgxNjAjCmUJanBn/ef338178/dbb/melting-glacier.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"160x160#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1SObscg","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"These shifts mean this area of the frozen expanse could increase Greenland\u2019s contributions to overall sea level rise in the coming years, the study researchers conclude.","sponsorship_footer":true,"channel":"World","channel_label":"World","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/world/"},{"_id":"56461ee312d2cd0c28000193","id":"2015/11/13/the-breakup-shop","title":"This company will break up with your partner for you","title_tag":null,"author":"Chris Perkins","post_date":"2015-11-13T17:33:10+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 17:33:10 +0000","sort_key":"1zXidM","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/11/13/the-breakup-shop/","content":{"plain":"Whoever said romance was dead in the modern age? I'm not sure, but they're probably right.\n\nThe Breakup Shop is a new company that will break up with your significant other for you for $10 to $40, depending on the service you select. In addition to breakup messages, the company also features a gift shop stocked with Netflix gift cards, Cookies and Call of Duty.\n\nSee also: I tried 13 dating apps in 30 days in search of love\n\nIn light of the recent \"Tinder for fighting\" hoax and The Breakup Shop's extremely kitschy website, you wouldn't be mistaken for thinking this is fake, but a writer for Motherboard actually paid the company $30 to \"break up\" with his girlfriend.\n\nI spoke with the two Canadian brothers who created the company, Mackenzie and Evan (both declined to give their full names), and they confirmed that they genuinely offer everything they advertise on the website. Additionally, the brothers confirmed that the Motherboard writer paid and used the service before reaching out to the company as a reporter.\n\nThe Breakup Shop will do your dirty work over text, email, phone or an actual physical letter. Texting is cheapest at $10, while a custom letter is $30. No one ever said class comes cheap. Adding a rush to your order will incur a $10 extra charge, though a rush email is only $5 dearer.\n\nCustomers have the option to craft their own personal messages with the company's \"expert breakup team,\" or said experts can write the message themselves with the customer's inputs. It's like a dystopian version of the movie Her.\n\nSince I'm going to save my girlfriend of three-and-a-half years the trouble of fake breaking up with her using The Breakup Shop, we'll have to use the intrepid Motherboard reporter's recorded call as a frame of reference. The Breakup Shop employee lists some of the reasons the reporter gave for wanting to \"break up,\" though he takes a step further, saying the reporter felt pressured to marry -- a reason for breaking up not given.\n\nAt the end of the call, The Breakup Shop employee pitched the reporter's girlfriend on the company's gift shop. I would say this was in bad taste, but using this service in any capacity is in bad taste, so what difference does a small upsell make? \n\nWould you like a Blu-Ray of The Notebook with that breakup?\n\nI asked the brothers where the inspiration for this service came from. Mackenzie told me he had been ghosted by a girl he'd gone on a few dates with and was frustrated by the experience. They figured that people use services like Tinder to get in relationships, so why didn't a service like Tinder exist for getting out of them?\n\nThe brothers say they're fighting the good fight against ghosting. \"I think it\u2019s kind of a good thing,\" said Evan. \"A lot of people these days think providing that text or call is not really necessary any more...it\u2019s kind of nice to get some of that closure.\u201d \n\nOf course, its sort of difficult to imagine the sort of person who would ghost someone as the type to spend their money on The Breakup Shop's services, but that doesn't mean it couldn't happen.\n\nWhether you think its worse to get ghosted or have a stranger breakup with you is your opinion, but the service's bluntness sort of makes sense in the rather blunt world of online dating. Both brothers agreed they'd be comfortable using the service themselves, though as they said to the Motherboard reporter, it's probably not the best choice for long-term relationships. It's more suited for shorter relationships that don't carry too much emotional baggage.\n\nSince garnering press attention, the brothers report a spike in customers over the last 24 hours and are looking for \"heartbreakers\" to join their team. The company says heartbreakers will \"change people's lives,\" which is a true thing to say.\n\nI asked if the brother's felt the emotional weight of ending relationships. \u201cIt\u2019s the break-uppers choice, we\u2019re just providing a service for them,\u201d they said.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

I have lots of stories to share from hanging out with my heroes and I look forward to giving my guests the inside scoop!\u201d \n\nWhether a night at the Star Wars shrine is your thing or not, Oldbury told the BBC there are four rules that must be obeyed: \n\n1.

Frame your friend's favorite meme\n\nFor all the times you and your bestie shared GIFs to laugh or spark a deep conversation about Internet culture, this gift is for you. Find a high-quality still of her favorite meme, print it and frame it so the inside joke can adorn her wall or desk. \n\n2. Splurge on an overnight getaway\n\nIf you share a mutual love for luxury, book a night at a hotel or spa and then have a grown-up slumber party by ordering room service and watching movies on demand.  Use an app like Cinamatic to turn your getaway into a short film you can share with each other. \n\n3. Relive that binge\n\nBeing obsessed with the same TV show can create a lifelong bond \u2014 just think what Scandal, Orange is the New Black and Sherlock have done for countless friendships. Try gifting one or more seasons via Apple or Google, or purchasing a Netflix gift card. Then, binge it together. (Or she can watch it on her plane ride to visit you.)\n\n4. Personalize her iPhone\r\n    Bad Girl. Tag your friends  A photo posted by  iPhone Cases Official (@iphonecases) on Oct 7, 2015 at 7:45pm PDT\n\nSince she can't live without it, make her iPhone truly special by giving her a unique case. Plenty of Etsy artisans specialize in iPhone cases, but you can also try a service like Shutterfly, which uses graphics and personal photos to make a memorable statement. \n\n5. Give deliciousness to your gourmand\r\n    Cured meats cure all cases of the Mondays. A photo posted by Chop Shop (@chichopshop) on Nov 2, 2015 at 5:35am PST\n\nNothing says eternal friendship like a basket of charcuterie and fancy cheese. Local butcher and cheese shops can offer recommendations on pairings, or you can opt for a regular shipment of delectable meats and cheeses. New York-based Murray's Cheese and California-based Cowgirl Creamery are good places to start. \n\n6. Help her pour a stiff one\n\nWhat's more symbolic of certain female friendships than the glass of Syrah, highball of whisky or stein of craft beer? If that sounds like you and your bestie, keep it simple by getting her favorite brand of booze. If you want to go over the top, sign her up for a tasting service like Tasting Room or Craft Beer Club. \n\n7. Find the perfect cozy accessories\r\n    New #free pattern by Simply Maggie is up on my blog!  These mittens are so warm and cozy.  Link is in my profile.  #knitmittens #mittens #chunkyyarn #simplymaggie #knit #fall #armknitscarf A photo posted by Amanda Bassetti (@simplymaggieblog) on Nov 2, 2015 at 2:41pm PST\n\nIt's clich\u00e9 but true: Countless female friendships have grown stronger thanks to commiserating over cold weather. Beautiful, hand-knit mittens, scarves and other cozy accessories are a nice reminder of just how much you get each other. For a tech-savvy friend, consider socks heated via lithium ion batteries ($99.95). \n\n8. Hit the pavement together\r\n    Amazing morning run with the @Momtrends ladies! #mtrun #runkeeper A photo posted by Runkeeper (@runkeeper) on Oct 22, 2015 at 7:31am PDT\n\nFriends who start the New Year ready to run can look forward to meeting their goals \u2014 and exceeding them. Help your bestie get motivated by gifting her the upgraded Runkeeper Go app ($39.99 per year). Make it personal by mapping a new run for the two of you that incorporates her favorite spots. \n\n9. Curate your favorite tunes\n\nMix tapes or playlists are about nostalgia or discovery. Curate the songs you obsess over with each other, or gift her a playlist with whatever theme you choose. Add an iTunes or Google Play gift card for something a little extra. \n\n10. Help her get caffeinated\r\n    Coffee all day. @hungryghostbrooklyn killing it in the cappuccino department. : @hungryghostbrooklyn A photo posted by Stumptown Coffee Roasters (@stumptowncoffee) on Oct 10, 2015 at 2:08pm PDT\n\nFriends who can share a cup of coffee or tea and talk for hours, are often friends for life. To celebrate that ritual, get your bestie a bag of speciality beans or tea leaves and include the fancy press or teapot she wants but won't buy herself. If she's super serious about her caffeine, introduce her to apps like Kohi ($2.99) or AeroPressTimer ($4.99), which include brewing tips and a brew timer. \n\n11. Get personal with custom jewelry\r\n    Christmas is around the corner! I can make a map necklace, cufflink set, key chains, and more of almost any city/country in the world! Find it at kimiko611.etsy.com or Facebook.com/thegreendaisy #thegreendaisy #kimiko611 #etsy #etsyshop #etsyseller #maps #mapjewelry #travel #familyhistory #christmasshopping #christmasgift #handmade #crafting #uniquegift #personalized @makersvillage #makersvillage A photo posted by Kimiko611.etsy.com (@thegreendaisy) on Oct 1, 2015 at 10:28am PDT\n\nCarrie Bradshaw may have loved her gold nameplate, but there's more to custom jewelry than just a name. Get creative with a nod to the experiences you shared in college or traveling together by giving her jewelry that incorporates geography or special mementos. Etsy is a great place to look for artisans who can make your vision come to life. \n\n12. Preserve your memories with a photobook\r\n    Though @pengtagram\u2018s work is created digitally\u2013 he looks to physical things for inspiration. \u201cMy work starts with a memory that I expand on until I have something concrete.\u201d #Ps25Under25 A photo posted by @photoshop on Oct 21, 2015 at 11:29am PDT\n\nGifting an old-school photo album is a sweet but time-intensive gesture. Try using online services like Zazzle or Snapfish to upload your pics and turn them into a charming hardcover book she can flip through for years to come. \n\n13. Get Selfish with a book of her selfies\n\nIf you're shopping for a friend who adores Kim Kardashian West but wouldn't get a thrill out of a traditional photo book, try curating all of her Instagram selfies into a Selfish-style photo book. Chances are you'll surprise her \u2014 and prove that your bond is deep and eternal.  \n\nHave something to add to this story?

New York Fed spokeswoman Andrea Priest said Dudley's comments were based on anecdotal observations by the deans and that she couldn't say who they are or what they said.\n\nWall Street got a black eye in the financial crisis and still hasn't recovered, as chronicled in various news articles. Christine Lagarde, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said on Nov. 5 at a conference arranged by the New York Fed that one of her sons had told her he might not talk to her if she were to work for a large investment bank. In the text of her speech, Lagarde said that in a ranking of public opinion of its integrity, the financial sector \"ranks third from the bottom, after government and tobacco.\""},"shares":{"linked_in":12,"facebook":64,"twitter":696,"google_plus":11,"total":783},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzkzL2Jpem1lZXRpbmcuOTEyMjguanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJOTUweDUzNCMKZQlqcGc/bb34d89d/2e9/biz-meeting.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzkzL2Jpem1lZXRpbmcuOTEyMjguanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMTQzOHgKZQlqcGc/d42a2a7f/2e9/biz-meeting.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzkzL2Jpem1lZXRpbmcuOTEyMjguanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMzU2eDIwNSMKZQlqcGc/443b5d4b/2e9/biz-meeting.jpg","query":true,"size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzkzL2Jpem1lZXRpbmcuOTEyMjguanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJNzEyeDQxMCMKZQlqcGc/0b222655/2e9/biz-meeting.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzkzL2Jpem1lZXRpbmcuOTEyMjguanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMjgweDE1NyMKZQlqcGc/39905037/2e9/biz-meeting.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzkzL2Jpem1lZXRpbmcuOTEyMjguanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJNTYweDMxNCMKZQlqcGc/f56dbfd9/2e9/biz-meeting.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1HO0dKs","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"velocity":[355,357,359,360,362,363,365,366,367,369,370,371,372,373,374,375,376,377,377,378,379,380,381,381,382,383,383,384,384,385,385,386,386,387,387,387,388,388,388,389,389,389,389,389,389,390,390,390,390,390],"show_sponsorship":true,"channel":"Business","channel_label":"Business","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/business/"},{"_id":"5646467fb05f9d19d1000192","id":"2015/11/13/neil-degrasse-tyson-movie-fact-checks","title":"Neil deGrasse Tyson doesn't care if you like his movie fact-checking","title_tag":null,"author":"Chloe Bryan","post_date":"2015-11-13T20:22:22+00:00","post_date_rfc":"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 20:22:22 +0000","sort_key":"1zXlV7","link":"http://mashable.com/2015/11/13/neil-degrasse-tyson-movie-fact-checks/","content":{"plain":"Astrophysicist and Star Talk host Neil deGrasse Tyson is well known for critiquing the science we see on the big screen.

Abrams is doing his best to echo the style of the original Star Wars trilogy, there's no larger example -- literally -- than the round Death Star-like thing that appears on the official Force Awakens poster. \n\nFans have wondered what the sphere might be; until now, it's pretty much been an open secret that it represents a vast new threat called Starkiller base. Now Abrams has finally broken his silence on the subject -- revealing that Starkiller is described in the movie as \"very much ... another Death Star.\" \n\nSee also: 'Star Wars' reveals new scenes on ABC: 'You might need this'\n\nBut the First Order, which arose from the ashes of the Empire, is thinking bigger than the Emperor ever did. While the Death Star can destroy planets in an instant -- as was so amply demonstrated on Princess Leia's homeworld Alderaan -- Starkiller destroys another class of galactic object altogether.\n\nHint: The object of its deadly affections is right there in its name. \n\n\"What it\u2019s capable of, how it works, and what the threat is, is far greater than what the Death Star could have done,\" Abrams tells Entertainment Weekly. \"Starkiller Base is another step forward, technologically speaking, in terms of power.\"\n\nIt's also not a million miles away from a superweapon mentioned in several Star Wars novels -- now demoted to the non-canonical status of \"Legends\" -- called the Suncrusher. \n\nIt makes sense that the First Order would only succeed by trying to outdo the firepower of its predecessor, the Empire. Abrams has an apt analogy: \"Evil\u2019s a little bit like a drug,\u201d he tells EW. \u201cIt takes more and more of it to have the same effect. And I think the First Order is a really deadly drug.\"\n\nStar Wars is a pretty addictive drug, too -- and anyone who has mainlined way too much of its history knows that \"Starkiller\" is also an homage to Luke Starkiller, the original name for Mark Hamill's hero. \"Skywalker\" was only substituted in at the last minute, right before Luke first spoke his name -- appropriately enough, to Princess Leia on the Death Star. \n\nChris Taylor is the author of How Star Wars Conquered the Universe."},"shares":{"twitter":792,"facebook":919,"google_plus":3,"linked_in":8,"pinterest":1,"total":1723},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzFlL3N0YXJraWxsZXIuMTA5ZDkuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJOTUweDUzNCMKZQlqcGc/3b8fc2b5/05d/starkiller.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzFlL3N0YXJraWxsZXIuMTA5ZDkuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMTQzOHgKZQlqcGc/4fc13eda/05d/starkiller.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzFlL3N0YXJraWxsZXIuMTA5ZDkuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJNjM4eDM2OCMKZQlqcGc/84f7a454/05d/starkiller.jpg","query":true,"size":"638x368#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzFlL3N0YXJraWxsZXIuMTA5ZDkuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMTI3Nng3MzYjCmUJanBn/09e174fd/05d/starkiller.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"1276x736#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzFlL3N0YXJraWxsZXIuMTA5ZDkuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMzU2eDIwNSMKZQlqcGc/84c14a69/05d/starkiller.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px)","size":"356x205#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzFlL3N0YXJraWxsZXIuMTA5ZDkuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJNzEyeDQxMCMKZQlqcGc/d04bd8ca/05d/starkiller.jpg","query":"(max-width: 1160px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"712x410#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzFlL3N0YXJraWxsZXIuMTA5ZDkuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMjgweDE1NyMKZQlqcGc/b41508fa/05d/starkiller.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px)","size":"280x157#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE1LzExLzEzLzFlL3N0YXJraWxsZXIuMTA5ZDkuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJNTYweDMxNCMKZQlqcGc/6f449d24/05d/starkiller.jpg","query":"(max-width: 480px) and (min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"560x314#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1lngvFv","choice":false,"mash_debut":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2015/11/12/star-wars-the-force-awakens-trailer-abc/"}]},"excerpt":"A third Death Star?

And so far, it's proving that small actions can make a big difference.\n\nSee also: Here's how you can help during the refugee crisis in Europe\n\nThe current campaign focuses specifically on Syrian refugee children living in the Za'atari refugee camp in northern Jordan, with the goal of providing school meals to approximately 20,000 children for one year.\n\nUsers also have the option to donate more money for greater impact -- $3.50 to feed one child for a week, $15 for a month, $45 for three months, $90 for six months and $182.50 for a year. The WFP will take 5 cents per donation to cover overhead costs.\n\nThe ShareTheMeal app was developed by Sebastian Stricker and Bernhard Kowatsch in April 2014 as part of the WFP Innovation Accelerator, which looks at various ideas, projects and initiatives that can accelerate progress toward reducing hunger.\n\nThey conducted a successful test launch for the app in June 2015, with more than 120,000 users in Germany, Austria and Switzerland providing more than 1.7 million meals for Lesotho schoolchildren in need.\n\n\"We are making progress on reducing global hunger,\" Stricker told Mashable. \"But if we want to achieve the goal of zero hunger by 2030, we feel we have to do something new.\"\n\nThat's why they turned to smartphones -- around the world, smartphone users outnumber hungry children by 20 to 1, according to the WFP.\n\nBut it was important to keep the app as simple to use as possible, Stricker said. Users will open the app to find a streamlined map with the current campaign country, and a big donation button front and center.\n\nYou can scroll down and get more information about where the money is going, and track the progress of the WFP's efforts -- transparent features users said they wanted during the test launch. There's also a social aspect; you can link your Facebook to the app to share causes with friends and family.\n\nNew in apps: @WFP launches #ShareTheMeal - a free app to help feed Syrian refugee children https://t.co/nWtPtXZF2U pic.twitter.com/MCYoiRhzN6\u2014 United Nations (@UN) November 12, 2015\n\nStricker said the current campaign for Syrian refugee children focuses on school meals because that has proven effective in breaking the cycle of hunger. It also helps increase access to education.\n\nThe campaign also raises awareness in the developing world, showing that 50 cents can make a huge impact on a child's life.\n\n\"For most of us, 50 cents is not too much. For a child who has nothing to eat, it's a full day of food. That's the emotional component to this project -- connecting those who have with those who don't,\" Stricker said.\n\nOnce the goal of providing meals to 20,000 Syrian refugee children is reached, the app will move on to another campaign. But as the team continues to develop and improve the app experience, Stricker said it's possible it will eventually address multiple causes and work with other organizations at the same time.\n\n\"We feel smartphones have enormous potential,\" Stricker said. \"It's really about enabling people to do good as easy as possible -- whenever they want, wherever they are.\"\n\nShareTheMeal is now available on iOS and Android phones.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Eight of the attackers are dead, seven after suicide bombings, according to the Paris prosecutor. \n\nFrance has responded with force, with President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande closing the nation's borders, halting all travel in and out of France, and promising that the military will flood the city. \n\nThe attacks began with reports of a shooting at a restaurant, Le Petit Cambodge, in a trendy neighborhood in central Paris. Moments later, witnesses reported hearing multiple explosions outside the Stade de France, where France was playing Germany in an internationally-televised soccer match. \n\nThen, numerous attackers opened fire from the balcony at a concert venue, Le Bataclan, where the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal was playing a show. People who escaped the hall said it was a massacre, with blood and bodies everywhere. At least 100 lost their lives there.\n\n\u201cTwo or three unmasked individuals came in with automatic weapons, Kalachnikov style, and started to shoot blindly into the crowd,\u201d one witness said to E1. \u201cIt was extremely violent and there was a sense of panic. Everyone ran towards the scene. There was trampling. Even I was trampling.\"\n\nThat witness, local journalist Julian Pierce, said the attackers reloaded at least three times. Pierce said the initial gunfire lasted around 15 minutes.\n\nLater early Saturday morning, the Paris police prefect said the attackers at Le Bataclan blew themselves up with suicide belts as police closed in. He said the gunmen first sprayed cafes outside the venue with machine gunfire, then went inside the concert hall and killed more before the assaullt by security forces.\n\nThe prefect, Michel Cadot, said the one set of attackers was at the stadium and at nearly the same time the second group attacked within the city.\n\nHollande, who was at the stadium, was reportedly evacuated and went to an emergency meeting at the Interior Ministry. Later, he delivered an official statement about closing the borders and initiating military forces. He urged caution among citizens. \n\nAlthough explosions could be heard during the game's broadcast, it continued to its completion. Authorities did not evacuate the stadium and hundreds of people swarmed the field, hugging each other, crying and seeking answers to the mayhem unfolding outside.\n\nNoah Nieman, an American who is visiting Paris for business, described scenes of chaos in central Paris. He was at a Phileu restaurant on the Avenue Richerand when he heard shots break out down the road coming from Rue Albert.\n\n\"A large crowd of people came running down the street towards us, so we ran inside the restaurant and into the basement,\" said Neiman. \"There were children crying and a huge crowd hiding down there. We really don't know what's going on.\"\n\nNeiman said a large police presence gathered near Rue Albert and one woman ran by saying she saw a body of one of the victims. He said several ambulances also sped through the area.\n\nAfter the initial shots rang out, there was a long pause and Neiman went back outside to see what had happened. Several police wearing flak jackets and helmets screamed at people on the street to get back inside.\n\nA second witness, Stephane Hannache, was broadcasting on Periscope during a portion of the attack and shots can be heard at the ten-minute mark in his video.\n\nOne person who posted images of the aftermath that showed broken windows with numerous bullet holes.\n\nTirs \u00e0 la Kalash au petit Cambodge dans le 10 \u00e8me \u00e0 #Paris plusieurs morts.

The death toll may rise as authorities continue to investigate.\n\nSee also: Live updates: Paris under attack\n\nAt least 1,000 people were attending a concert featuring the American rock band Eagles of Death Metal at the historic Bataclan when gunmen took concertgoers hostage.

Hurt Bad! There are survivors inside. They are cutting down all the world. One by one. 1th floor soon!!!!,\" he posted in French as the gunmen were active.

The man, local journalist Julian Pierce, told local news outlet Europe 1 that he saw \u201cseveral armed individuals\" come into the middle of the concert hall.\n\n\"Two or three unmasked individuals came in with automatic weapons, Kalachnikov style, and started to shoot blindly into the crowd,\u201d said Pierce. \u201cIt was extremely violent and there was a sense of panic. Everyone ran towards the scene. There was trampling. Even I was trampling.\"\n\nPierce said the initial gunfire lasted around 15 minutes. \n\n\"The assailants had the time to recharge at least three times,\u201d said Pierce, who said the gunmen were not wearing masks and appeared to be young.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t say a word, not that I could hear,\" Pierce said. \u201cThere were a dozen cadavers on the ground, in pools of blood.\"\n\nHiding in the attic\n\nLes Monde journalist Elise Barthet said several survivors, many wearing blood-stained clothing, were being interviewed by police in a bar near the Bataclan venue. According to two witnesses, who Barthet interviewed, one of the shooters said \"everything is the fault of your president.\"\n\nBarthet tweeted that many people in the theater survived the attack by hiding. \"At the Bataclan, dozens of people who were on the floor during the concert survived by hiding in the attic,\" she wrote. \n\nOne survivor told Barthet that police told them \"do not look\" as they were taken out of the Bataclan, while another said \"shooters were in the dressing rooms when the police arrived.\"\n\nBloody battlefield\n\nWitness Marc Coupris told the Guardian it was \"carnage\" inside the concert hall. He said he was with 15 friends attending the concert when the attack started. He hit the ground, with another man lying on top of him as they tried to remain quiet while the gunman fired. \n\n\"It looked like a battlefield, there was blood everywhere, there were bodies everywhere. I was at the far side of the hall when shooting began. There seemed to be at least two gunmen. They shot from the balcony,\" he said. \n\n#Paris Bataclan survivor: \"People threw themselves to the ground but the gunmen just started firing at random at the people on the ground\"\u2014 Angelique Chrisafis (@achrisafis) November 14, 2015\n\nMany people watching the show believed the sound of gunshots, which started about 30 minutes into the concert, were part of the performance.\n\n\"The concert had started. I was in the audience and I heard what sounded like a firecracker. It was loud but the gig was very loud and I thought it was something that was part of the show. I think lots of people did too ... There were wounded, there was a lot of blood. Blood everywhere,\u201d a concertgoer J\u00e9rome Boucer also told the Guardian. \n\nGennie Watson, a mother who doesn't normally attend concerts, told France 24 she was sitting in the balcony area of the Bataclan when the gunshots started.\n\n\"At first I thought it was a joke,\" she said. \"People started to panic. People started ducking under their seats ... I had no idea [what was going on].\"\n\nShe said once her and her friends realized what was happening, they calmly made their way to the door -- but they didn't understand the scale of what was going on until they got outside and saw the carnage.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

It was a beautiful fall evening in the city.\n\nDespite a mid-November chill that arrived Friday afternoon, restaurant terraces and sidewalks were bustling when a wave of terror attacks killed at least 120 people. Now, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has declared a state of emergency, and is sending 1,500 military into the streets.\n\nI suspect I may wake up to a different city.\n\nEerily quiet streets.

Not since World War II has this city seen so much bloodshed. Bodies were counted by the dozen, and overnight the French news media were churching out headlines of \"carnage,\" \"massacre\" and \"war.\"\n\nNews of the severity of the attacks spread slowly on the street.\n\nAs I made my way from Op\u00e9ra back in the direction of Place de la R\u00e9publique about 20 minutes after the first incident was reported, there was no panic -- only the visible movement of people down Boulevard Saint-Martin, away from one of the six reported attack sites.\n\nMost of the people still on the street are walking casually in the direction away from the incidents\u2014 Jessica Plautz (@jessicaplautz) November 13, 2015\n\nBut as I got closer, the crowds thinned, and the sounds of sirens were more persistent.\n\nAt a bar, a group of people gathered outside, standing around a television to watch the breaking news.\n\nWatching the news. #Paris pic.twitter.com/Xh4iY37Jzt\u2014 Jessica Plautz (@jessicaplautz) November 13, 2015\n\nSeveral restaurants were already emptied, but bar patrons were less quick to go home. Instead, drinks moved inside, with some bars stacking outdoor tables and chairs and closing front doors -- even partially pulling down safety gates and turning off front lights -- while patrons moved further inside to await more information.\n\n#Paris pic.twitter.com/h7HctbOXDH\u2014 Jessica Plautz (@jessicaplautz) November 13, 2015\n\nOn Boulevard Saint-Martin, I came upon several stores that had almost completely shuttered -- some with customers still inside them -- before arriving at a police blockade.\n\nEvening shoppers will apparently be in there a while pic.twitter.com/zmMMKfy8cz\u2014 Jessica Plautz (@jessicaplautz) November 13, 2015\n\nPolice blockade on Boulevard Saint Martin #Paris pic.twitter.com/L3KKYZwGGZ\u2014 Jessica Plautz (@jessicaplautz) November 13, 2015\n\nAlthough pedestrians cleared the streets quickly, cars did not: Police turned taxi after taxi away from the blockade, sending them down side streets and to circuitous routes to get around the massive tragedy.\n\nIt was unclear how serious the situation was until I got to the large blockade at Rue du Temple, where a dozen police stood with guns drawn. After one man was taken into custody, it seemed to be a waiting game as police held people back but offered no further information.\n\nPolice with guns drawn #Paris pic.twitter.com/kmG7gWCW8T\u2014 Jessica Plautz (@jessicaplautz) November 13, 2015\n\nEventually, about 30 people started to stream out from sheltering inside a building and past the blockade, with police guiding their way to safety. Families and groups of teenagers moved quickly to safety, asking people standing outside the blockade for an explanation just as they were met with questions for more information.\n\nA man and woman each carried one of their two sons, all had a look of relief even though the shock was obvious. Another man, carrying a helmet, pleaded with police to be able to get his motorcycle back on the other side of the blockade. He wouldn't be able to retrieve it for another half an hour.\n\nMeanwhile, ambulance after ambulance after ambulance arrived on the scene.\n\nFamily just came past police blockade; safe but scared pic.twitter.com/Q6bUlpiNxt\u2014 Jessica Plautz (@jessicaplautz) November 13, 2015\n\nA cool evening became a cold night as ambulances slowly left the scene one at a time, in tragic contrast to their swift arrival.\n\nWaiting. #ParisAttack pic.twitter.com/3yCQF9NT05\u2014 Jessica Plautz (@jessicaplautz) November 13, 2015\n\nAs I made my way back to my hotel, the silence was cut only by distant sirens and a few inebriated pedestrians.\n\nA couple kilometers from Place de la R\u00e9publique, a row of bars remained open. Inside, televisions were tuned to the news showing Hollande, and the ever-present Parisian couples looked like they were holding each other just a bit tighter.\n\nWhen I did get back, a new reality made itself apparent: I spent 10 minutes communicating with a hotel clerk through a locked door, holding my ID up to the glass and signaling my room number to prove I did indeed belong inside the building.\n\n\"I'm sorry for the inconvenience,\" the clerk said, as he finally let me in and explained the precautions.

An active Facebook group brings residents together to discuss the issues. The social media campaign managed to get the chief minister\u2019s attention, who announced steps to curb the foaming. \n\nR you proud of this? #DigitalIndia #BellandhurLake #Bangalore @PMOIndia @CMofKarnataka @PrakashJavdekar @ramanathrai pic.twitter.com/GVD9a79bnO\u2014 Sanchita Jha (@sanchitajha) October 7, 2015\n\n@CMofKarnataka Sir...please take action.

In May, the lake caught fire -- something that was possible because of the high level of hydrocarbons and oils in its water, a by-product of the industrial waste dumped in the lake by nearby companies. \n\n\"It spread like a forest fire,\" a resident named Abhinandan Y recalls. \"Today, the edges of the lake are pitch-black as if it's been burnt.\u201d\n\nToday, he says, the smell of the lakes is close to unbearable.\n\n\"The stench is so horrible that you have to close your nose to stand near the bridge,\" Abhinandan Y says. \"Even then, the air is so toxic that you can\u2019t stay for more than one minute.\" \n\n@bbmpadmn its a fire in lake foam in bellandur lake. Its burning itself to 2-5 feet height. Help us sir pic.twitter.com/TGxxQ1iLZh\u2014 Vishrut (@mr_vishrut) May 15, 2015\n\nBengaluru, where Bellandur Lake connects to the nearby Varthur and Agara lakes, was once known as the City of Lakes. But environmental experts say that decades of rampant construction and industrialisation have destroyed these bodies of water which all have become noxious brews of thick and smelly froth. The high amount of phosphates (commonly found in detergents) in the water created the froth, which gets aggravated during heavy downpours.  \n\n\"We monitored almost 80 lakes in Bengaluru and found out that 98 percent of lakes face a similar problem,\" says T Ramachandra, a professor at the Indian Institute of Science. When Ramachandra and his students visited Bellandur Lake to collect water samples, they returned with skin rashes, headaches and nausea.\n\nThe contaminated lake also poses health hazards to local residents. The surrounding wells, which supply drinking water to the residents, have been contaminated as has the fields of vegetables which are grown downstream. There are rising cases of dengue, the chikungunya virus and respiratory diseases in the area. \n\n\"The air is so bad that the elderly die from a common cold and cough,\" Abhinandan Y adds, \"and everybody has a migraine problem.\" \n\nAfter rain, clouds of foam rising from the lake obstruct the bridge passing over the lake, causing traffic snarls in the process. \n\nThese sprinklers r no match for #BellandurLake foam @bbmpadmn.

Despite several laws to protect the surrounding wetlands, Bellandur Lake is lined with high-rise apartments whose sewage discharge only worsens the pollution. \n\nDespite an order passed by the High Court in 1999 asking civic authorities to clean the lake, few concrete steps have been taken. Ramachandra points that it is still possible to rejuvenate the lake through de-silting and creating an integrated treatment plan, as the one that helped revive the Jakkur Lake close by. \n\n\"Already Bangaloreans are paying a heavy price due to the mismanagement of resources,\" Ramachandra says. \"Bangalore has crossed threshold of growth.

Everyone ran towards the scene. There was trampling. Even I was trampling.\" Pierce said the initial gunfire lasted around 15 minutes.\n\nThe Twitter account @TRAFidf, which typically posts traffic updates from in and around Paris, turned its attention Friday night to re-sharing desperate pleas of other Twitter users trying to contact loved ones. The tweet below translates as, \"Call @MrAntoineDaniel a friend still has no news of his friend Phillipe.\"\n\n#ATTENTATS APPEL @MrAntoineDaniel Une amie n'a toujours pas de nouvelles de son ami Phillipe pic.twitter.com/Jz3ZIQ4ota\u2014 ROUTES Paris IdF (@TRAFidf) November 14, 2015\r\n \n\nSeveral government agencies also used their Twitter accounts to point people towards help lines. \n\nThe French Ministry of the Interior launched a website for witnesses to share information about the attacks and for people to report missing friends and family.\n\nUsers are able to file a report using a quick three button system on the site, and police will respond by contacting them directly. The site also allows people to anonymously report information that might aid in the investigation into the attacks.\n\nAs the night drew on, some people recounted stories of being able to find relatives safe and sound. Professional soccer player Antoine Griezmann tweeted earlier in the evening that he could not locate his sister who was at the Bataclan concert venue. \n\nHe later tweeted, \"Thanks God my sister was able to exit the Bataclan.

The new powers included the authority to confiscate weapons and shut down concert halls, both of which are usually relegated to local governments.\n\nParis had already shut down all of its Metro stations and services such as Uber were suspended as the city encouraged citizens to go home and stay there on a bewildering night of terrorist attacks. A series of other major public spaces were also closed.\n\nAfter the siege at the Bataclan, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande -- who had been evacuated from another attack area -- visited the theater while surrounded by a thick formation of officers.\n\nThe city also closed off its iconic Place de la Republique, where a statue of Marianne, the symbol of the freedom of the French nation, presides over pedestrians and nearly daily protests and rallies.\n\nThe Stade de France, a major soccer stadium in the city's suburb of St. Denis, was the site of an explosion earlier in the evening. Hollande, who was in attendance at the France-Germany soccer match there, was evacuated from the site. The rest of the crowd was kept inside after the final whistle. The stadium is expected to be closed as well.\n\nThe city's airports, however, remained open after France backtracked from its promise to \"close\" borders and instead instituted border checks and heightened inspections. \n\nToutes les salles de spectacle ferm\u00e9es demain en \u00cele-de-France\u2014 H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pagesy (@Lnpagesy) November 14, 2015\n\nThe city appears determined to keep all Parisians off the streets tomorrow.

The gunmen, who were young, were not wearing bulletproof vests or any tactical gear, the witness added. \"I could have met him before and never thought he was a terrorist,\" the witness said of one of the gunmen. \n\nThe band Eagles of Death Metal, which had been scheduled to perform at the Bataclan, reportedly escaped offstage as the attacks began.\n\n#paris Bataclan dozens and dozens of empty stretchers being rushed towards scene by running medical staff\u2014 Angelique Chrisafis (@achrisafis) November 13, 2015\n\n#Paris Bataclan survivor: \"People threw themselves to the ground but the gunmen just started firing at random at the people on the ground\"\u2014 Angelique Chrisafis (@achrisafis) November 14, 2015\n\nOrganizers also canceled a two-day concert backed by former U.S. Vice President Al Gore to raise awareness of the U.N. Paris climate summit. The concert, called \"Live Earth: 24 Hours of Reality,\" was supposed to go from noon Friday Eastern time to noon Saturday. Gore, stationed at the Eiffel Tower, was the MC for the event, which was webcast globally.\n\nNeil Young, Duran Duran and \"Take Me to Church\" singer Hozier performed earlier in the day.
